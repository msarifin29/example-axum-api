This repository is a small Rust project scaffold intended as the starting point for implementing an HTTP API using the Axum framework.

## Goals

- Provide a minimal, well-documented project that demonstrates how to build an HTTP API with Axum and Tokio.
- Show recommended project layout, common dependencies, and quick start instructions.
- Describe next steps for implementing endpoints, middleware, configuration, tests, and deployment.

## Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (stable) installed. See https://rustup.rs
- Cargo available on your PATH (installed with rustup)
- (Optional) Docker for containerized builds and deployment

## Quick start

1. Clone the repository and change into the project directory.
2. Build the project:

```bash
cd {your_path}/example-axum-api
cargo build
```

3. Run the project (if a main is provided):

```bash
cargo run
```
